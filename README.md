## Hi there, nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹


I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at Politecnico di Milano and I am **currently working on my Master Thesis about Anomaly Detection**.  
My studies are focused on Machine Learning and Data Science since my Bachelor Degree. I had to thank the course of Artifical Intelligence for this because it allowed me to discover this beautiful field that was unknown to me.  

:mortar_board: **Education:**
 - Master of Science in Computer Science and Engineering at `Politecnico di Milano`
 - Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at `UniversitÃ  Degli Studi di Firenze`

<!---
:computer: **Most Relevant Work Experience:**
 - IT Area Manager at *Jeflo - Junior Enterprise Florence* | March 2017 - Dec 2018
 - IT Area Member at *Jeflo - Junior Enterprise Florence* | May 2016 - March 2017
  
  
#### What is a Junior Enterprise?
It's a **no-profit association of students** with the main goal of practise what we are studying.  
The concept, as described also in [JE Website](https://juniorenterprises.it/en/), is very simple: `"A Junior Enterprise gives students the opportunity to put their theoretical knowledge into practice through the realization of projects and studies required by companies, institutions or individuals."`
