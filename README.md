## Hi there, nice to meet you 👋


I graduated from Politecnico di Milano with a master's degree in computer science and computer engineer, and I received my bachelor's degree from Iowa State University, USA.  
I have published research in Springer focused on deep learning. I also co-wrote a book chapter, which will be published in Elsevier.
